= From Prototype to App: Deploying the Agent as a Service

[NOTE]
====
Persona: Platform Engineer (primary). Also relevant: AI Engineer.
====

[IMPORTANT]
.In this lab
====
You will turn the agent you prototyped in the previous module into a running service on OpenShift. We will deploy the `ai-agent` tenant, build and expose the FastAPI app, and wire the Tekton pipeline trigger so failures send context to the agent which then creates a GitHub issue.
====

[NOTE]
====
Estimated time: 60–90 minutes
====

== Objectives

* Deploy the `ai-agent` tenant resources
* Point build configs to your GitHub fork
* Build and roll out the agent service (FastAPI)
* Verify connectivity to Llama Stack from the app
* Wire the pipeline trigger so failures call the agent
* Validate end-to-end by creating a GitHub issue from a failure

== Prerequisites

* Completed xref:module-05.adoc[Module 05] with a working agent flow in the notebook
* Your repo fork is up to date and the cluster GitOps points to it
* Llama Stack server reachable inside the cluster (module 04 deployment)

== Deploy the ai-agent Tenant

* Confirm the project exists and resources are present:
+
[source,bash,options="wrap",role="execute"]
----
oc get ns ai-agent
oc -n ai-agent get deploy,svc,route,cm,sa,rolebinding,secret
----

* If resources are missing, ensure your GitOps/App-of-Apps includes the tenant. Then sync in Argo CD.

== Point to Your GitHub Fork and Correct the Webhook Path

By default the tenant and Helm chart reference `redhat-ai-services/etx-agentic-ai` and post to `/webhook`, while the FastAPI app exposes `/report-failure`.

* Set your GitHub username:
+
[source,bash,options="wrap",role="execute"]
----
export YOUR_GITHUB_USER=your-gh-user
export YOUR_FORK=https://github.com/${YOUR_GITHUB_USER}/etx-agentic-ai.git
----

* Update the tenant Tekton Pipeline to use your fork and the correct endpoint:
+
[source,bash,options="wrap",role="execute"]
----
sed -i "s#https://github.com/redhat-ai-services/etx-agentic-ai.git#${YOUR_FORK}#g" \
  infra/tenants/ai-agent/base/sno/templates/pipeline.yaml

# Use the app's actual endpoint
sed -i "s#/webhook#/report-failure#g" \
  infra/tenants/ai-agent/base/sno/templates/pipeline.yaml
----

* Update the Job that triggers a PipelineRun so it also uses your fork:
+
[source,bash,options="wrap",role="execute"]
----
sed -i "s#https://github.com/redhat-ai-services/etx-agentic-ai.git#${YOUR_FORK}#g" \
  infra/tenants/ai-agent/base/sno/templates/job.yaml
----

* (Optional, if using the Helm chart locally) Update the chart defaults:
+
[source,bash,options="wrap",role="execute"]
----
sed -i "s#https://github.com/redhat-ai-services/etx-agentic-ai.git#${YOUR_FORK}#g" code/chart/values.yaml
sed -i "s#/webhook#/report-failure#g" code/chart/values.yaml
----

* Commit and push changes so GitOps applies them:
+
[source,bash,options="wrap",role="execute"]
----
git add .
git commit -m "tenant(ai-agent): use my fork and correct webhook endpoint"
git push
----

== Ensure Secrets and Config

* Verify `agent-config` points to your Llama Stack service. Defaults to the in-cluster service:
+
`infra/tenants/ai-agent/base/sno/templates/configmap.yaml`
+
[source,yaml]
----
data:
  LLAMA_STACK_URL: "http://llamastack-with-config-service.llama-stack.svc.cluster.local:8321"
  MODEL_ID: "llama-4-scout-17b-16e-w4a16"
  TEMPERATURE: "0.0"
  MAX_TOKENS: "5000"
----

* If needed for your Llama Stack config, hydrate any missing secrets (GitHub, Tavily) as per module 04/05.

== Build and Roll Out the App

* Trigger the build PipelineRun via the provided Job (creates a new run):
+
[source,bash,options="wrap",role="execute"]
----
oc -n ai-agent create -f infra/tenants/ai-agent/base/sno/templates/job.yaml
----

* Watch the PipelineRun in the OpenShift Console (Pipelines) until tasks complete.

* Verify the Deployment rolls out:
+
[source,bash,options="wrap",role="execute"]
----
oc -n ai-agent rollout status deploy/ai-agent
oc -n ai-agent get pods
----

* Get the route and test health:
+
[source,bash,options="wrap",role="execute"]
----
ROUTE=$(oc -n ai-agent get route ai-agent -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
curl -s http://${ROUTE}/health | cat
----

[TIP]
====
Reset/retry tips:

* If `pip install` upgraded dependencies earlier, restart the Jupyter kernel before re-running notebook cells (module 05)
* Stop previous port-forward (`Ctrl+C`) before starting a new one
* If a PipelineRun is stuck, cancel and start a fresh run; ensure Workspace PVC is recreated when using `generateName`

== Pipeline overview

This demo application pipeline models a common CI/CD flow and adds an automated recovery aid:

* Fetch source: `git-clone` pulls your repo and revision
* Build image: `buildah` builds and pushes the container image
* Deploy: `oc rollout status` verifies the deployment
* Finally: On failure, a `finally` step triggers the agent service with pod context

Coming from xref:module-05.adoc[Module 05]: You codified the agent and validated the flow in a Workbench. Here we connect that flow to your pipeline so failures automatically notify the agent.

== Wire the Pipeline Trigger

The Tekton `agent-service-build` Pipeline includes a `finally` step that posts a failure payload to the agent service.

* Confirm the `finally` step now points to `/report-failure` and `namespace: ai-agent` in:
+
`infra/tenants/ai-agent/base/sno/templates/pipeline.yaml`

* Ensure the `ai-agent` service account/rolebinding exist in the `ai-agent` namespace:
+
[source,bash,options="wrap",role="execute"]
----
oc -n ai-agent get sa pipeline
oc -n ai-agent get rolebinding openshift-pipelines-edit
----

== End-to-End Test

To simulate a build failure and test the agent integration, use the pre-configured `bad` revision.

*Option 1: Web Console*

1. In the OpenShift Web Console, navigate to **Pipelines** in the `demo-pipeline` namespace.
2. Click on the `agent-service-build` pipeline.
3. Click **Start** to create a new PipelineRun.
4. In the parameters, set the `GIT_REVISION` value to `bad` to use the intentionally broken revision.
5. Start the PipelineRun.

*Option 2: Run a pre-created Job*

From the console, create a job from YAML using the `infra/tenants/demo-pipeline/base/sno/templates/job-bad.yaml` as a reference, or run via CLI:

[source,bash,options="wrap",role="execute"]
----
oc -n demo-pipeline create -f infra/tenants/demo-pipeline/base/sno/templates/job-bad.yaml
----

Feel free to use the web console or CLI to trigger the job.

*Option 3: One-off PipelineRun via CLI*

Start a one-off PipelineRun with the `bad` ref:

[source,bash,options="wrap",role="execute"]
----
oc -n demo-pipeline create -f - <<'EOF'
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1
kind: PipelineRun
metadata:
  generateName: agent-service-build-run-bad-
  namespace: demo-pipieline
spec:
  taskRunTemplate:
    serviceAccountName: pipeline
  pipelineRef:
    name: agent-service-build
  params:
    - name: APP_NAME
      value: "ai-agent"
    - name: IMAGE_NAME
      value: "image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/ai-agent/ai-agent"
    - name: GIT_REPO
      value: "https://github.com/${YOUR_GITHUB_USER}/etx-agentic-ai.git"
    - name: GIT_REVISION
      value: "bad"
    - name: PATH_CONTEXT
      value: "code"
  workspaces:
    - name: workspace
      volumeClaimTemplate:
        spec:
          accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
          resources:
            requests:
              storage: 3Gi
EOF
----

* Intentionally break the build (e.g., temporarily change `code/Containerfile` to an invalid base) and trigger a build:
+
[source,bash,options="wrap",role="execute"]
----
oc -n ai-agent create -f infra/tenants/ai-agent/base/sno/templates/job.yaml
----

* When the PipelineRun fails, the `finally` step calls the agent. The agent reads logs via MCP OpenShift, searches the web, and creates a GitHub issue.

* Verify:
** Console → `ai-agent` → Workloads → Pods show agent logs with tool calls
** Your GitHub repo shows a new issue with the summary

== Artifacts to carry forward

* Route URL for `ai-agent` (health verified)
* Updated tenant pipeline/job YAML pointing to your fork
* A sample failed PipelineRun name and failing pod name
* URL of the created GitHub issue

== Troubleshooting

* If the PipelineRun cannot reach the agent route, verify the Route/Service are ready and DNS resolves in-cluster.
* If the agent times out on Llama Stack, confirm the server is healthy and reachable from the `ai-agent` namespace.
* If MCP tools are not registered, revisit module 04 to re-register `mcp::openshift` and `mcp::github` in Llama Stack.
* If no GitHub issue is created, check the agent logs for the tool call to `create_issue` and ensure the GitHub MCP server is configured.

== What’s Next

With the agent running as a service and integrated with the pipeline trigger, you have the foundation for a production rollout. You are now setup for a scenario where you have a new ticket coming in and you need to update your agent and your MTTR is fast due to the automation. Perhaps you are event adventurous enough to add the agent tooling itself as a `finally` call in your agent build pipeline to catch and resolve errors quickly. We will not be doing that today, so that will be left to the reader, but in the next module, we will discuss hardening, observability, and promotion flows.
== Next Steps

With your agent now running as a service and integrated with the pipeline trigger, you have established the foundation for a production-ready workflow. This setup enables rapid response to failures, as new issues are automatically created in your GitHub repository, reducing mean time to resolution (MTTR).

In the next module, you will learn how to further harden your deployment, add observability, and implement promotion flows to ensure your agent remains robust and reliable as you move toward production.

Onward to Module 07!
